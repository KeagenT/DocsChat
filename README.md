# Docs Chat
Docs Chat is a UI interface for [langchain's](https://hwchase17.github.io/langchainjs/docs/overview) document loader
embedding wrapper, used to fit Documentation, Books, or any other kind of "Document" into retrieval context for an LLM.
I'm using it here with [GPT-3.5](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) to "talk" with documentation I don't really
understand.
